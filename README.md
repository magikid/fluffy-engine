# nix-home

My nix home manager configuration.  This will eventually replace my [dotfiles](https://github.com/magikid/LinuxConfigFiles/) repository and maybe even my [ansible](https://github.com/magikid/ansible) repository once I get NixOS figured out.

## Usage

This repository expects nix to already be installed.  See [home-manager docs](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.xhtml#sec-install-standalone) for info on how to install home-manager.  Once nix and home-manager are installed, clone this repository to `~/.config/home-manager` and run `home-manager switch` to activate the configuration.
